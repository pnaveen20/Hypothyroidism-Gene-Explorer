            ### Genetic Basis of Hypothyroidism
            Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder characterized by insufficient production of thyroid hormones. 
            These hormones are crucial for regulating metabolism, growth, and development. The condition can be caused by 
            various factors, including autoimmune diseases (e.g., Hashimoto's thyroiditis), iodine deficiency, and genetic mutations.

            **Key Genes Involved:**
            - **TSHR (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor)**: Mutations in this gene can impair the thyroid gland's response to TSH, leading to hypothyroidism.
            - **PAX8 (Paired Box 8)**: This gene is essential for thyroid gland development. Mutations can result in congenital hypothyroidism.
            - **DUOX2 (Dual Oxidase 2)**: Involved in the production of hydrogen peroxide, which is necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis. Mutations can disrupt this process.

            ### Gene Expression Analysis
            Gene expression analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. 
            By measuring the activity of genes across different conditions or tissues, researchers can identify biomarkers, 
            therapeutic targets, and pathways involved in disease progression.

            **Applications:**
            - **Biomarker Discovery**: Identifying genes whose expression levels correlate with disease states.
            - **Pathway Analysis**: Understanding the biological pathways affected by changes in gene expression.
            - **Drug Development**: Discovering potential drug targets based on gene expression profiles.

            This app provides tools to explore gene-related data for hypothyroidism and visualize gene expression patterns, 
            aiding in the understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of the disease.
